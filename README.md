The Samaritan Interface is a CLI (Command Line Interface) that look's like the Samaritan A.I. from the T.V. show Person of Interest.

In other words, you will be able to feed text into a file and get the Samarita to display it into his terminal with basic graphics.

I want to make him operate like a personal assistant (i.e. Siri, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Cortana etc.), that will operate offline (and online) in your own Node-RED server.

That means that you can upgrade-downgrade him and much your need's, from waking you up in the morning with fresh coffee to unlocking your front door and controling your smart home, all from a sleek and simple interface.




This is a difficuld project, any help is more than welcome. I do this as I am curently studing so any updates (espesialy the smart home part) will take some time to come, but eventually (I hope) it will be ready and free for all, I may even start a Kickstarter on the way, who knows.
